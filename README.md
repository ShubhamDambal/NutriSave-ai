# 🍱 Smart Food Waste Management System

A full-stack web platform designed to reduce food waste by intelligently matching surplus food sources with NGOs, food banks, and individuals. It combines real-time data dashboards, predictive ML modeling, and blockchain transparency to ensure sustainable and efficient food redistribution.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Food Donors (Restaurants, Events, Households)** register and upload surplus food details (type, quantity, cooking time, etc.).
2. A **Machine Learning model** predicts the expiry of food based on parameters like:
   - Food Type (vegetarian, non-vegetarian, dairy, etc.)
   - Cooking Time (in minutes)
   - Storage Temperature (°C)
   - Humidity (%)
   - Quantity (grams/kgs)
3. Based on expiry predictions, the system prioritizes food redistribution to ensure **safe consumption before spoilage**.
4. NGOs and food banks view available food in **real-time on an interactive map** powered by Leaflet.js and can accept/reject donations.
5. All redistribution transactions are logged via **blockchain** for traceability and trust.
6. Users are notified of collection/delivery, and donors can track their impact over time.

## 🔬 ML Model: Expiry Prediction

**Goal:** Estimate the shelf life of donated food to enable timely redistribution.

**Features Used:**
- `foodType`
- `cookingTime` (in minutes)
- `storageTemp` (°C)
- `humidity` (%)
- `quantity` (g/kg)

**Output:**  
- Predicted expiry time (in hours)
- Categorization: Safe / Soon to Expire / Expired

The model is trained using historical food spoilage data and is served through a Flask API to the main web platform.
